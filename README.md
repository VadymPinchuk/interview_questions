This repository provides a collection of algorithmic tasks that have been resolved for the purpose 
of preparing for FAANG (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, Google) interviews. 
While some of these algorithms may be too complex for actual FAANG interviews and may never be used there, 
as the author of this repository, I have decided to include them for visibility. 

By exploring and practicing with these algorithms, you can develop a deeper understanding of various data structures and algorithms, 
sharpen your problem-solving skills, and prepare yourself for the challenges that you may face during a FAANG interview.
